/** CAN commands for the MKS SERVO57D/42D/35D/28D stepper motor driver modules.
 * Each message must have its checksum appended.
 * Uses big-endian encoding.
 *
 * The checksum function is a simple 8-bit sum-of-bytes. A sample Python implementation is:
 * @code{.py}
 * cs = 0

 *     cs = (cs + x) & 0xFF

 * # Nominal Operating Conditions {#noc}
 * When used, "nominal conditions" refers to a stepper driver configured to be in 16-microstepping mode along
 * with a 200 step/rev motor.
 * These are the conditions the manual authors assumed, and thus many hard-coded computations are based on it.
 * Particularly, the manual documents the motor speed units to be "RPM".
 * This is only true for these conditions; a speed of "1 RPM" actually corresponds to 3200 steps per minute.
 * If a 200 step/rev motor is being used in full-step mode, a speed command of "1 RPM" will instead move the
 * motor at \f$v = 1 * \left(\frac{3200\ steps}{min}\right) \left(\frac{1\ full-step}{step}\right) \left(\frac{1\ rev}{200\ full-steps}\right) = 16\ RPM\f$

     * This command allows two distinct functions to be enabled.
     *
     * The first affects the driver's zeroing behaviour.
     * @ref POWER_ON_HOMING_MODE can be used to automatically home the motor when power is restored, however in some
     *   applications this may not be safe.
     * When using the pulse interface, a @ref GO_HOME command cannot be sent to trigger the homing sequence.
     * Through the `en_trigger` flag, the driver can be programmed to instead begin homing when a 200ms pulse is received
     *   on the En pin.
     * Note that @ref POWER_ON_HOMING_MODE must be programmed for this to occur as the driver needs to know which
     *   direction, speed, etc. to move when the sequence is triggered.
     *
     * The second affects the driver's motor protection system.
     * If the `pos_error_protection` flag is enabled, the driver will enter the locked rotor shaft state if the position
     *   error is greater than a certain threshold within a time window.
     * I am not entirely clear on what this means, but the manual states that: "within x time, if the motor position
     * error is greater than y, the protection is started".
     * My interpretation is that "errors" refers to missed steps, and the goal is to enter the protection state when a
     *   certain number of steps are missed within a certain timeframe.
     * For example, an application may find it  beneficial to lock the motor if 5 steps are missed in 100ms.
     * The manual states that "when Errors = 28000, the motor is misaligned by 360Â°", but I do not understand what this
     *   means or if it contradicts the above.
     *
     * If the position protection system is triggered, the driver screen displays "Wrong2".
     * Note that "Wrong" is displayed on the screen when the stall protection system triggered.
     *
     * The flags are encoded into a byte according to:
     * | Bit     |  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |      1       |            0            |
