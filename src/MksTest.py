## The maximum speed the driver can spin a motor, depending on the work mode.
# The values are nominally:
# | Work Mode | Max Speed [RPM] |          Work Mode Description           |
# | :-------- | :-------------: | :--------------------------------------- |
# |  CR_OPEN  |       400       | Open loop, pulse interface               |
# |  SR_OPEN  |       400       | Open loop, serial interface              |
# |  CR_CLOSE |      1500       | Closed loop, pulse interface             |
# |  SR_CLOSE |      1500       | Closed loop, serial interface            |
# |  CR_vFOC  |      3000       | Field oriented control, pulse interface  |
# |  SR_vFOC  |      3000       | Field oriented control, serial interface |
#
# However, these values actually indicate the maximum step rate, computed assuming the driver is set to 16-microstepping.
# If another microstepping mode is used, the maximum speed will be adjusted.
# Despite this, the motor speed cannot exceed 3000 RPM regardless of microstepping mode.
#
# For example, if using CR_OPEN at quarter-stepping, the maximum speed is 1600 RPM instead of 400 RPM.
#
# Note that if a speed greater than one of these is used, the motor will instead spin at the applicable maximum.
#
# TODO: It is not clear from the manual whether *_CLOSE and *_vFOC were computed using 16-microstepping, or perhaps 32-
#       and 64-microstepping respectively.

## The maximum acceleration ramp a motor can use.
# When acceleration is set to 0, the motor instantaneously accelerates to the target speed.
#
# When not set to 0, the current speed of the motor increases by 1 RPM per tick, and the acceleration value controls the
#   time between ticks.
# Therefore, the speed of the motor is governed by:
# \f[
#   t_{next} - t_{now} = (256 - \alpha) * 50 [\mu s] \\
#   v_{next} = \begin{cases}
#               v_{now} + 1,   &   v_{now} \le v_{target} \\
#               v_{now},       &   v_{now} = v_{target} \\
#               v_{now} - 1,   &   v_{now} \gt v_{target}
#              \end{cases}
